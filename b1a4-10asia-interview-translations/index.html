<div style="text-align: left;"><b>Shining B1A4 (interview)</b><br /><i>How was our five years old? Our words are clearer than just &#8220;uh&#8221; and &#8220;ah&#8221;, our steps are definitely faster than our small steps. When asked &#8220;What do you want to do when you grow old?&#8221; they could use all the fingers to count and have dreams with high expectations. B1A4 6th debut anniversary resembles a 6 years old kid who is growing up well. When we asked them about things regarding the music they love, the stage, promotions and their fans, their eyes sparkle like a kid and answered, the shining six years old B1A4.</i></p>
<p><b>Q: It is your 6th year anniversary.<br />JY: </b>Time flew past. Our debut felt just like yesterday (laughs) however, as the years pile up, we also want to do better. <br /><b>GC:</b> We are the most thankful to the fans who have been with us for the past 6 years. We are looking forward to the things that will unfold in the future. We wished for the time during fanmeeting and concert to pass by slowly, and the days to just pass quickly. We want to spend more time with the fans.</p>
<p><b>Q: You guys have been together for more than 6 years. What are some of the things that have changed or have not changed? <br />SD: </b>Firstly, my appetite has always been the same. (All laughters)<br /><b>BR: </b>Members all got more comfortable. We have been together for 9 years since trainee days. They felt like friends but at the same time felt like family. </p>
<p><b>Q: If you were to illustrate the members as a family member?<br />SD: </b>Jinyoung would be a mischievous 5 years old. (All laughters) CNU would be someone younger&#8230; about 3 years old? When one was really cute.<br /><b>GC: </b>Sandeul would be a year 2 middle school kid going through puberty.<br /><b>SD: </b>Make that year 1 of high school.<br /><b>BR:</b> I feel like a university student. I have been wanting to travel a lot recently.<br /><b>JY:</b> Gongchan feels like 50 years old.<br /><b>BR:</b> Nono, an elementary school kid who likes to play game!<br /><b>SD: </b>Games and age has no relation. Gongchan feels like a 30 years old uncle.<br /><b>BR:</b> No, an elementary school kid. He jokes around a lot.<br /><b>CNU:</b> Let&#8217;s settle with elementary school kid. Channie looks really cute when he jokes around.<br /><b>SD:</b> Let&#8217;s make it 5th grade elementary school class president!</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>Q: There are members that I am curious about. &#8220;Mischievous 5 years old Jinyoung&#8221; and &#8220;Cutie 3 years old CNU&#8221;?</b></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>BR:</b> Shinwoo is someone who has very serious thoughts originally. However, he has recently got cuter. He used to get troubled over what kind of coffee to drink but recently he just goes straight &#8220;Ice Americano&#8221;, &#8220;Ice Choco&#8221;!</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>JY:</b> I still like Strawberry Yoghurt smoothie.<br /><b>SD: </b>And that makes you feels like a mischievous 5 years old. You only like to eat things that can&#8217;t be found anywhere easily. If we don&#8217;t get it for you, you would throw a tantrum in front of the shop. (laughs)</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>Q: What would be the colour of B1A4 who has debuted for 6 years?<br />SD:</b> B1A4 fills up the album with songs that we make. As the five members live, and as we try to put what we felt into the songs, the sentiments that B1A4 had during then can be found in our music. Wouldn&#8217;t that be B1A4&#8217;s colours?<br />BR: It would be hard to describe it with a word. However, from what I heard from people around us, they would say &#8220;B1A4 is good as expressing B1A4&#8221;.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>JY:</b> I feel happy when I hear such words. If you come to know about and say &#8220;Ah, this is B1A4&#8221;, when you listen to a music, I find it a competitive edge. That is our goal. To be a group which can carry our own colour. I am constantly troubled about that.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>BR: </b>It is a fun worry. We have fun together and release our stress through music.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>Q: The first half of the year was mostly focused on overseas promotions. You guys did a 4 cities tour in USA this February.</b></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>BR:</b> Its been a few years since our USA tour. It was always amazing. There were a lot of people who came to watch it this time too.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>SD:</b> Usually our USA fans would only sing along to the english lyrics, but this time round, there were local fan boys and they were even singing along to our Korean lyrics. (laugh)</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>Q: There were such passionate fans (laughs) What do you think would be the reason why fans with different nationality, race and language like B1A4?</b></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>JY:</b> We are also curious about that. I think people in Korea likes us because of our relatable image. On the other hand, we wonder if there are other reasons as to why overseas fans likes us even though we are unable to go to them often?</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>BR:</b> So I asked around (laughs) Someone I know in USA told me that it is because among the many Kpop artists, the energy that we produce when we are together is good.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: center; clear: none; float: none;"><span class="imageblock" style="display:inline-block;width:540px;;height:auto;max-width:100%"><img filemime="image/jpeg" filename="2017052619503110822-540x698.jpg" height="698" src="http://cfile2.uf.tistory.com/image/252A39345946337519D4BD" width="540"/></span></p>
<p></p>
</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>Q: Usually when we talk about Kpop artists, we tend to think of knife sharp dance moves. On the other hand, B1A4 stages are more towards being emotional and freestyle.</b></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>CNU:</b> That&#8217;s our differentiation.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>JY:</b> (Being really serious) But really, if we want to do it, we can.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>SD: </b>If it is too sharp, those watching might get cut so we don&#8217;t do it. (all laughs)</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>CNU:</b> We prefer songs that we can have fun together, and make such music. I think it matches with the performances too.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>Q: Are there any countries B1A4 which to penetrate into?</b></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>BR: </b>Whenever we do performances overseas, we will always think that there are more fans hiding in other countries. I feel that even as we work hard and promote in Korea, we will also need to work hard and promote overseas too.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>JY: </b>I want to perform in England. Because of a layover, we only managed to watched a performance (laugh)</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>BR: </b>I want to go Africa. I want to perform on the same land that the animals are running on.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>GC: </b>What are you going to do when the lions bite you?<br /><b>BR:</b> On a vast land outdoor (pretend he didn&#8217;t hear it)</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>JY: </b>You just need to on your bluetooth speaker.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>SD:</b> Go live at the airport.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>Q: You have been putting your own works into your albums. Your 3rd full length album Good Timing was mostly produced by Jinyoung as well as composed and written by Shinwoo.</b></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>JY: </b>We originally all like music, (so producing music) its possible.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>SD:</b> However, sitting besides Jinyoung makes me think I wouldn&#8217;t be able to produce music. You can&#8217;t sleep well, you arrange the songs, does the mixing, mastering&#8230;</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>BR:</b> Especially when we were writing songs for the previous album, I feel very bad for Jinyoung. He was going on varieties and drama, and even preparing the album. When I look at him, I wonder if I would be able to take it.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>Q: 2016 was really Jinyoung&#8217;s year. You had non-stop activities. Mnet Produce 101, God of music, KBS2 Love in the Moonlight, and even B1A4&#8217;s album.</b></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>JY:</b> Even though it was like that, I had a good time. If we received the song from another song writer and only did our own producing, the feeling would be different. Good Timing was an album where we thought about with the members, write songs, and it was also something that we want to show fans after a long time, so it was fun. I wanted to quickly edit the song so that I can let the members and the fans listen to it. Be it mixing or mastering, I feel the best when the members&#8217; reactions are good, and I will feel a sense of accomplishment.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>Q: Other than Jinyoung, other members were also breaking through in their own areas. CNU musical, Sandeul solo album, Baro and Gongchan dramas.</b></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>BR:</b> We always monitor each other through our chatting room on the messenger.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>CNU: </b>We will send captures of dramas or upload them on to SNS to promote. Ah, last year when Sandeul and I was doing musical &#8220;The Three Musketeers&#8221; with double casting for D&#8217;Artagnan, Baro came to watch the performance for about three times. Gongchan sat through the whole day to watch two performances. It wasn&#8217;t something easy and I am thankful.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>BR:</b> It was fun even though I watching it three times. Because even though it was the same character, the way Shinwoo hyung and Sandeul portray it is different.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>Q: Your loyalty to each other is amazing.</b></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>JY:</b> However, they ignore the drama. (Towards CNU &amp; Sandeul) You guys come to the filming set!</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>BR: </b>That&#8217;s right. When we are filming for drama, the members will only cheer for us through the phone. On the other hand, Yoo Yeon Seok hyung and Son Hojun hyung came to the filming set to cheer on me&#8230;</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>CNU, SD:</b> We will go! we will go!</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>JY:</b> Send a coffee truck to the filming site!</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>SD:</b> I promise (all cheers)</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>Q: There is something I want to congratulate Gongchan for. Recently he appeared on web variety &#8220;존잘러&#8221;. It is a variety that has amazing visuals of boy group to appear, I have to agree that he is a &#8220;face genius&#8221; (laughs)</b></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>GC:  </b>Vixx Hongbin, Astro Cha Eunwoo also appeared on it. I appeared on the last episode. They said I was &#8220;the final round boss&#8221;. (laughs)</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>JY:</b> Gongchan is really, looks on top!</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>SD: </b>Before we debut and I was to come up to Seoul to be a trainee, I had a video call with the members. When I saw Gongchan&#8217;s face, I thought I had to go to Seoul. He is the most good looking guy I&#8217;ve even seen in my entire life.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b><br /></b></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>Q: Do you also share with your members on the difficulties you faced during your solo activities?</b></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>JY:</b> We do such stuffs. When I am working with a director for the first time and the members knows about it, they will ask me how was the filming set atmosphere.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>CNU: </b>Recently when Baro was acting in Closed Eyes, he was going through a difficult time as the character.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>BR: </b>In Closed Eyes, I am acting as a singer who is pretending to be blind. Before this, I acted as a psycho path murderer in God of noodles. The feeling of the two characters feels the same. I was troubled about how to make the details of the two characters different.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>JY:</b> Baro constantly take on difficult roles. As the years goes by, he is acting characters which people can relate to. I think he is doing well.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>Q: Even though it is a character in Closed Eyes (the novel), it is different from the web movie.</b></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>BR: </b>This is the first time Closed eyes is made with a low budget and releasing as a paid content. When I started with this production, I was hoping that it could go onto the big screens to meet more people rather than staying as a low budget movie. Together with the actors in the movie, I hope that there will lots of opportunities going to look for them. With such a heart, I came to film Closed Eyes.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>JY:</b> As much as a short film or a short drama can be really good, but there are a lot of situations whereby they don&#8217;t get the attention that it deserves. I feel that it is an area where all will need to work hard together for.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>Q: When CNU &amp; Sandeul act in a musical, it is also has limited viewers.</b></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>CNU: </b>That&#8217;s right. I keep on feeling about this as I continue to do musicals. Including me, many musical actors, performers and production team worked very hard for the production and I hope that we can get more love from the public. This isn&#8217;t a one person&#8217;s problem. I hope our society and public can be become one that embraces many different kinds of culture.</div>

<div style="text-align: left;"><b>Q: As we look back the 6 years, let&#8217;s talk about the time when you became strength for one another.</b></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>GC:</b> There was one day when I fell really sick. I usually don&#8217;t tell when I am sick, but on that day I was so sick I had to take a rest from the schedule.I felt really sorry and before the hyungs left, I went to the car and apologised. However, the hyungs all said &#8220;It is more important to rest and get well. We will take care of your empty slot.&#8221; Baro hyung also brought porridge and other stuffs to my house.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>BR:</b> However, we weren&#8217;t able to fill your empty slots.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>JY: </b>Channie&#8217;s face is so shiny we can&#8217;t fill that. (All laughs)</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>Q: The first half of 2017 has went by. Give a score for yourself now at mid-way.</b></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>GC:</b> 40 points for me. The remaining 60 points will need to be filled up with the remaining 6 months.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>BR:</b> I want to give myself 90 points. If I get 10 more points, I should receive a present! (All laughs) (T/N: Saying in a very cute tone)</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>SD:</b> Mine would be 60 out of 120 points.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>JY:</b> Why is there 120 points.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>SD: </b>There are 12 months in a year! Even though we weren&#8217;t able to promote domestically in the first half of the year, but everyone has been working very hard even before we started releasing out 3rd full length album and even right now with overseas promotions and solo activities, we are taking them on without rest.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>JY:</b> I would give myself 50 points.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>CNU: </b>I would give myself 5 points. I am not satisfied. I will have to work harder (laughs)</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>Q: So in order to get 100 points (120 points for Sandeul) in 2017, what are some of the things that you wish to do?</b></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>SD:</b> I want to have activities so that we can see the fans a lot. Self produced reality, Whenever the members go on a holiday on their own and come back, we will always say &#8220;I want to do this together with the members.&#8221; I think it would be good if we get to do a program where we go to various places and introduce them.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>GC: </b>I want to do a variety like B1A4&#8217;s Youth over flowers. The real us we are together, I want to show about our own story.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>CNU: </b>I want to release lots of albums. Like how my heart wants it, I want to release one weekly. (laughs) I want B1A4 to constantly be releasing music and standing on the stage, I think if we were to do that, it would be like a gift to the fans.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>JY: </b>I want to release something even if its not a full length album. Project, single, collaboration, all sorts of music activities. Even if we don&#8217;t go on shows, I want to be able to let them hear more of our music. Our members all have their own charms. I hope that even if its not something of their area, they will still be trying to take it on.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b><br /></b></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>Q: Then recommend something for your member&#8217;s solo activities.</b></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>JY: </b>I think Sandeul will do well acting in a sitcom.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>SD:</b> I want to act as an important role.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>JY: </b>I hope that Channie can be a character like an internet novel main guy. I hope Baro would broaden himself as an actor.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>GC:</b> Not only in acting, but I hope to do more genre in terms of music as well. Jinyoung hyung is good in DJ-ng, and I hope that Sandeul will do trot like how Big Bang Daesung did.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>SD:</b> It seems like I am really multi-talented (all laughs)</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>BR: </b>I hope CNU hyung can release a solo album. Since his dance moves are nice so I hope it is a dance genre.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>JY: </b>(laughs) This are all thanks to everyone doing well in their own areas, we have a lot of greed.</div>

<div><b>CNU:</b> Satisfaction after a stage. As much as the anxiousness before a stage gives me butterflies in my stomach, but the latter keeps my heart in suspense.</div>
<div><b>SD:</b> Of course I like the satisfaction after a stage, but if there isn&#8217;t an anxiousness before going up the stage, then there will not be the satisfaction that comes after the performance, so I like both.</div>
<div><b>BR: </b>I like the latter. It is all worthwhile and happy after being with the fans.</div>
<div><b>GC: </b>The satisfaction after a stage. Standing on the stage and looking at the fans makes me very happy. When we come down from the stage after a performance, it felt like we did something with the fans. I really like those moments.</div>

<div><b>Q: Dance song vs Ballad song, which one do you like more?</b></div>
<div><b>JY:</b> I think I really can&#8217;t choose from this. Because I really like both, depending on situations, the music I listen to is also different.</div>
<div><b>CNU: </b>I think there are a lot of people who will choose dance songs but I would choose ballad. As the time goes by, it might also change.</div>
<div><b>SD:</b> I like Dance song because I think it makes me healthy, and I like the delicate energy that emerges from the song, so I like both.</div>
<div><b>BR:</b> Dance song, It always makes me happy and uplifted.</div>
